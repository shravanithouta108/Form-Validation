# 📃 Form-Validation-

This project is a simple web-based registration form that includes form validation, course-based fee display, and a print feature. Users can enter their **Hall Ticket Number**, **Name**, and choose a **Course** from a dropdown. After clicking the **Submit** button, the corresponding **fee amount** for the selected course is automatically shown in a text box. The user is then redirected to a new page displaying all submitted information, which can be printed.
